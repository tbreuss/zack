# Zack!

Zack! is a compact microframework, built on the [HttpKernel Component](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_kernel.html) of Symfony, that emphasizes file-based routing.
It includes various route handlers for handling HTML, JSON, [Markdown](https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/), and PHP files with ease.
Additionally, Zack! integrates [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/), a powerful template engine, making it a good choice for small, easily manageable website and API projects.

## Requirements

- PHP: 8.2 / 8.3 / 8.4
- Composer: 2.x
